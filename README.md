A [Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) plugin to check Debian for package updates.

This plugin runs continuously and prints an output in the interval requested by Telegraf.
In addition, the output can be triggered externally, e.g. during `apt update` to get the latest status in almost real time.
The Debian wiki is queried to check the [LTS status](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS).
You can make use of [needrestart](https://github.com/liske/needrestart) to check the system for outdated libraries.


## Configuration

Install `curl`. Also `needrestart` if you like to use it.

To make this plugin useful you need a way to keep your package sources up to date.
You can use `unattended-upgrades` to run `apt update` on a regular basis.

To trigger the plugin to collect new stats after an `apt update`, create a `Post-Invoke` configuration.
You can copy [99telegraf](99telegraf) to `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99telegraf` or use it as example.

Telegraf can be configured like this:

```ini
[[inputs.execd]]
  command = ["/bin/sh", "/opt/telegraf/telegraf-apt.sh"]
  data_format = "influx"

  interval = "24h"
  signal = "SIGUSR1"
```

If Telegraf is able to run `needrestart` with sudo privileges, the corresponding metrics will be collected:

```
telegraf    ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/needrestart -b
```


## Output

```sh
# sh /opt/telegraf/telegraf-apt.sh

apt debian_codename="Bullseye"
apt debian_support=0
apt updates_regular=0
